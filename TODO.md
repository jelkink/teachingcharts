# To do

- Allow Variable 3 to set the color of a scatter plot.
- Add statistical significance test for box plots (assuming one or two categorical and one continuous variable)
- Place the regression tables at the centre bottom of the screen, rather than in the bottom-right under “Info” as that might make them a bit more readable/less narrow.
- On the regression table, the second variable is listed first, and the third variable under it. Should it be vice versa? 

# Bugs

- Left-Right can take 10 values, but in the regression table, I see 5. Is it normal?
