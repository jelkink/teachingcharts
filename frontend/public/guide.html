    <h1>Teaching Charts - User Guide</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.joselkink.net/teachingcharts/" target="_blank">Teaching Charts</a> is a web interface developed by <a href="https://www.joselkink.net">Johan A. Dornschneider-Elkink</a> for the production of basic plots, using small, cleaned data sets for the purpose of teaching.</p>

        <p>This web interface is designed to strengthen data literacy and visual data interpretation of students across political science courses. No coding or advanced statistical knowledge is required to create plots.</p>

    <h2>Interface</h2>

        <p>The interface is organised into four panels:</p>
        <p><strong>Data Panel</strong>: This section is used to select the dataset, choose a graph type, and assign variables. All selections are immediately reflected in the plot area.</p>
        <p><strong>Options Panel</strong>: This section allows adjustment of the appearance and structure of the graph. Switching from counts to proportions displays relative distributions. Activating the jittering function (particularly useful for scatter plots) slightly and randomly shifts overlapping points to reveal data density. To explore a third variable, a regression line can be added, or subsets can be created.</p>
        <p><strong>Info Panel</strong>: This panel displays basic descriptive statistics for the selected variables (such as distributions and descriptive summaries of values) and provides basic inferential statistics.</p>
        <p><strong>Plot Area</strong>: The plot updates instantly based on the selected variables and options.</p>

    <h2>Plots</h2>

        <p>There are a number of different types of plots available in Teaching Charts, and what might be confusing at the start is that different options and different variable selections only have an effect with some of the plots, and not others. This section outlines for each type of plot what settings will be relevant.</p>

        <h3>Bar charts</h3>

            <p>Bar charts can be made using one or two variables. If only Variable 1 is selected, a univariate bar chart will be produced. When Variable 2 is also selected, the bars will be grouped based on the categories in Variable 2 and, for each group, the univariate distribution of Variable 1 will be displayed. Variable 3 will be ignored.</p>

            <p>Two options have an impact on bar charts. The proportions switch allows you to switch between bar charts based on raw frequencies (or counts) to bar charts based on proportions. When both Variable 1 and 2 are selected, the proportions will be calculated within each category of Variable 2.</p>

            <p>The second option that has an impact is the subsetting option, which is explained below.</p>

            <p>Bar charts will be accompanied by a table providing the Chi-squared and Cramer's V statistics, to test whether there is sufficient evidence that the variables are not independent from each other.</p>

        <h3>Histograms</h3>

            <p>Histograms are in many respects similar to bar charts, but can only be utilized for single variables. Variables 2 and 3 are ignored.</p>

            <p>In addition to the subsetting option (see below), the histogram can be customized based on the number of bins. The bins lever can be moved from using on one bin on the left, to twenty bins on the right. The proportions switch also impacts on histograms and works identically do the bar charts.</p>

            <p>A small technicality: the bins of the histogram are defined such that the range is inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the upper bound, except for the last bin, which is also inclusive of the upper bound.</p>

        <h3>Scatter plots</h3>

            <p>Scatter plots are based on Variables 1 (y-axis) and 2 (x-axis), while Variable 3 is ignored, unless a regression line is added.</p>

            <p>In addition to the subsetting option (see below), scatter plots have two main options to customize the graph: jittering and regression lines. With the jittering option, the points on the scatter plot will be randomly moved by a small amount, so that it is revealed where many points overlap. This is particularly useful for survey data, where each variable typically only has a limited number of possible values, even when we treat it as a scale level variable. The amount of random noise that is added can be manipulated with the associated lever.</p>

            <p>The second helpful option is the possibility to add a linear regression line, based on ordinary least squares estimation. A simple click on the switch adds the regression line to the plot. Here, when Variable 3 is selected, different regression lines are computed for each of the categories on Variable 3, as outlined in the legend below the plot.</p>

            <p>When a regression line is added, a regression table is also provided, included significant tests for each of the coefficients. When both Variable 2 and Variable 3 are selected, an interactive model is produced, where Variable 2 continues to be treated as a scale variable, while Variable 3 is treated as a categorical variable. The main idea is to test whether the relationship between variables 1 and 2 hold when looking at different subgroups defined by Variable 3.</p>

        <h3>Box plots</h3>

            <p>Box plots can be either used for a univariate plot by only selecting Variable 1, or as a bivariate plot with plots on the categories of Variable 2 side by side, or as a trivariate plot, with for each of the categories of Variable 2, different colors based on the categories of Variable 3.</p>

            <p>Only the subsetting option has an impact on box plots.</p>

            <p>Box plots are accompanied by a table providing the results of a one-way (only Variable 2 selected) or two-way (both Variable 2 and Variable 3 selected) analysis of variance (ANOVA), including significant tests for each of the factors.</p>

        <h3>Subsetting</h3>

            <p>The subsetting option requires the tick box to be marked and also two selections to be made before any effect is visible: the variable used for the selection needs to be identified and within that variable, the category needs to be selected. Once this is done, the plot will only be produced for that particular subset of the data.</p>

    <h2>Data sets</h2>

        <h3>Irish National Election Study 2020</h3>

            <p>This data set is a random subsample of the Irish National Election Study 2020 available on the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ines2020">Harvard Dataverse repository</a>. After a selection of variables and a random sample of cases are determined, any missing data has been interpolated preserving the univariate distribution - but not taking into account the joint distribution with other variables.</p>

        <h3>Test data</h3>

            <p>This is a miniature data set to test and demonstrate the functionality of Teaching Charts.</p>
